			<p>“What sets M5 Systems apart is their technical expertise and their commitment to excellence through every step of the network design, testing, and implementation process. We have engaged M5 on a number of projects over the years, most recently to design an Internet access solution that provides carrier diversity with dynamic failover, and to improve backup traffic flows between data centers. M5 understood our business and technical requirements and implemented a highly effective solution. The infrastructure they designed and built with us has been great – I speak of it with pride to whomever is willing to listen.”</p>

			<p>“Pixability recently relocated to a new office space, and needed a network consulting partner that could keep pace with our aggressive move schedule. M5 Systems assessed our requirements, and designed a cloud-managed solution that provides WiFi and wired connectivity with the high level of security and performance we require. M5 built, tested, and deployed the new network on time and within budget, and equipped Pixability with a reliable and effective network.”</p>
