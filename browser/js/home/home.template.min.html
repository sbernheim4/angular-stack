Over the next year, I want to go to work with dynamic and achievable solutions to make us as good as we can be.</p><p>The tone I seek to set is bold for a Student Union, yet detailed and doable, and centers on areas of transparency, access, and community. I care about building a Union that is more open and sensitive to student needs than ever. Together, we will work to build a bright future for the Brandeis community.</p><a ui-sref="policy"><button>Read Jacob's Policy Proposal</button></a></div></div><div class="home__issues"><div class="container"><h2>The Issues</h2><div class="home__issues__flex-container"><div class="home__issues__flex-container__access"><img src="http://placehold.it/150x150"><div><h3>Access</h3><p>Advocate for increased off-hour and weekend health services, especially at the Brandeis Counseling Center</p><p>Start the conversation about reducing the practice of free student labor on campus</p><p>Continue the fight for free and accessible Menstrual Products</p><p>Call upon the administration to include a laundry quota in financial aid</p><p>Advocate for students facing food insecurity</p></div></div><div class="home__issues__flex-container__transparency"><img src="http://placehold.it/150x150"><div><h3>Transparency</h3><p>Release the budget.</p><p>Modernize the Student Union's resources and communications.</p><p>Create “Essential Guides” for Student Union and Brandeis administration functions</p><p>Do a better job engaging, and at points disagreeing, with administration members</p><p>Amend A-Board and Treasury procedures to better work for clubs with unique needs</p><p>Continue to grow the bond between the Student Union and the Graduate Student Association</p></div></div><div class="home__issues__flex-container__community"><img src="http://placehold.it/150x150"><div><h3>Comunity</h3><p>Guarantee funding parity for clubs representing diverse and marginalized groups</p><p>Promote a Student Union that reflects Brandeis Students</p><p>Work for a greener campus</p><p>Continue our work towards enacting universal bystander intervention training</p></div></div></div></div></div></section>
