# What is this Repo

This repo is an easy and quick way to get an angular website running. It uses AngularJS and its UI-Router for the front end and NodeJS/ExpressJS for the backend.
Gulp is used to compile SCSS, transpile ES6 JS and minify it along with HTML and allow for livereloading.
It is essientially, a very simple version of the MEAN stack without MongoDB.

# File Structure

Below is the file structure for this stack. Each state goes in its own folder, and each folder contains the html, controller.js and state.js files. All the scss files go in the scss folder
```
|--app/
|------browser/
|------|---js/
|------|-------stateName/ --> (each angular state goes in its own folder)
|------|-----------stateName.state.js
|------|-----------stateName.template.html
|------|-----------stateName.template.min.html --> (minified copy of html file, generated by gulp)
|------|-----------stateName.controller.js
|------|---scss/ --> (all the scss files go here. index.scss imports all the other listed files)
|------|-------stateName.scss
|------|-------index.scss
|------server/
|------|---public/ --> (contains the gulp generated css and js files)
|------|-------index.css
|------|-------main.js
|------|---index.html
|------|---index.js --> (runs the ExpressJS server)
|------gulpfile.js
|------package.json
```
